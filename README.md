### Hi there 👋
I'm a coding instructor and a full stack software engineer who is very eager to learn new things and meet new people!

I don't have a specific stack, as I'm happy to code with anything, but here is what I have been using recently:
#### Front-end: TypeScript, react, NextJS, tailwind, sass, Vercel.
#### Back-end: TypeScript, NodeJS, express, graphql, postman, mocha and chai

you can follow me on [Medium](https://medium.com/@osamaakb) for some blogs too (:
